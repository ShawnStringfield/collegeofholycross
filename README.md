Work Assignment

Used latest version of Node (v11) to get this setup. Once you run the project from the command line there will be a local IP displayed under localhost. That URL will allow you to view the site on any device simultaneously although I didn’t build this out for mobile devices this is usually how I test on many difference screen sizes while I’m working. Updating the code will automatically update all devices that hits that url.  Also, just in case, I also deployed a copy to firebase.com and you can find the link here:
